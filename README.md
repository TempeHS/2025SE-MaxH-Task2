# Student Performance Predictor: Insights into Student Performance and Contributing Factors

This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) project aimed at analyzing and predicting student performance based on various contributing factors such as socioeconomic background, academic history, and extracurricular activities. The project leverages educational datasets to build predictive models that can help educators, policymakers, and students understand the key drivers of academic success and identify areas for improvement.

# Business Problem

- Educational institutions and policymakers often struggle to identify the key factors that influence student performance. Understanding how factors such as socioeconomic background, study habits, and extracurricular activities impact academic outcomes can help educators design targeted interventions and improve overall student success.

- This project aims to provide actionable insights into the factors that contribute to student performance and develop predictive models to forecast academic outcomes based on these factors.

# Machine Learning Problem

- The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts student performance (e.g., GPA, test scores) based on several input features.

# Success Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the machine learning model, the following success metrics will be used:

- Does the model generalise well to training data, testing data and new data that has been caputured during operation
- Does the model score a low Mean Squared Error(MSE)

# Data Overview

- I have sourced a raw validated dataset from The Australian Beauro of Statistics. The data is saved in the CSV file [1.1.4.Student_Scores_Data.csv](/1.Model_Development/1.1.Data_Wrangling/1.1.4.Student_Scores_Data.csv).

- The data columns are:
