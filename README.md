# Predicting Future Income Based on Early-Life Factors

This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) project aimed at predicting the future income of students 20 years into the future based on early-life factors such as education, socioeconomic background, and demographics. The project leverages data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to build a predictive model that can guide students, educational institutions, and policymakers in making informed decisions about education and career paths.

# Business Problem

- Educational institutions, policymakers and students often find it hard to predict their long-term financial outcomes based on early-life factors like education, socioeconomic background and demographics. A clearer understanding of these factors impact on future income can guide students in making more informed decisions about their education and career paths.

- The Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) provides big data on education and employment trends, offering the chance to build a machine learning model that estimates a studentâ€™s income 20 years into the future. The model can provide insight into economic mobility and inform policy decisions aimed at improving financial outcomes for students from many backgrounds.

# Machine Learning Problem

- A Linear Regression model that predicts the income of students in high school, 20 years in the future based several input features given by students.

# Success Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the machine learning model, the following success metrics will be used:

- Does the model generalise well to training data, testing data and new data that has been caputured during operation
- Does the model score a low Mean Squared Error(MSE)

# Data Overview

- I have sourced a raw validated dataset from The Australian Beauro of Statistics. The data is saved in the CSV file [2.1.2.Education_Income_Data.csv](/2.Model_Development/2.1.Data_Wrangling/2.1.2.Education_Income_Data.csv).

- The data columns are:
